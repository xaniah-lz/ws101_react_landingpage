          Web development is essential for creating and managing websites and
          web applications. It involves front-end development, which focuses on
          the user interface and user experience using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, and back-end development, which handles server-side logic
          and database interactions with languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby.
          Full-stack development integrates both front-end and back-end skills
          to build complete web solutions. Effective web development enhances
          user experience, supports branding and marketing efforts, improves
          search engine visibility, and provides valuable data through
          analytics. As technology evolves, web development adapts to meet new
          challenges and opportunities in the digital landscape.
